## Working with modules

### Step 1

Write a simple number guessing game. Your game should import [the `random` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#module-random) to generate a random integer between 1 and 20. When the program runs, it should prompt the user for a guess and then tell them if their guess was too high, too low, or correct.

_Hint_: There is an example of how to accept user input on the command line in Jupyter notebook `03 - Input and Output`.

### Step 2

Modify your game so that it tells the user how many tries it took them to guess the right number.

### Step 3

Limit the number of tries a user has to guess the number correctly. If the user doesn't guess it in the number of tries you've limited them to, they lose.

### ðŸ”¡ Variation

If you get all this working, create another version of the game that asks the user to guess a letter of the alphabet, and gives hints based on the alphabetical order of the playerâ€™s guess.

Your user should be able to choose whether they want to play number guess or letter guess when the game starts.
