## Example Request to Upload a File

This is an update (notice the PUT verb) to an existing record. In this case you are including the file itself as the body of the request (notice it in the second position as an argument to `put()`) and setting specific headers required by the server to handle the binary file attachment.

```js
axios.put(url, file, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Token ' + token,
    'Content-Type': file.type,
    'Content-Disposition': `attachment; filename=${file.name}`
  }
}).then(res = res.data)
```
