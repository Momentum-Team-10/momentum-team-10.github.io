This is **ALL OPTIONAL**. Please remember to take time to rest and relax during the break.

## ‚úÖ TODO for Everyone

- Reflect on where you are in this program. You've learned a lot and you have a lot left to learn. What are YOUR goals? Use this [Goals Reflection exercise]({% link goals-reflection.md %}) to re-energize for what's ahead and focus on what you want to accomplish.
- Create a schedule that you can stick to for the times you will not be in class (see the time management resources below for some suggestions on managing your time effectively).
- [Learn markdown](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/) (more resources listed below)
- Pick a note-taking application that will let you take notes while you read and work. It's important that it can properly format code blocks. Here are some options (don't overthink this choice -- just pick something that you feel comfortable with).
  - [VS Code](https://helgeklein.com/blog/2020/10/vs-code-as-markdown-note-taking-app/) (with this option you could create a simple git repo with markdown files)
  - [BoostNote](https://boostnote.io/)
  - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
  - [Typora](https://typora.io/)

## ü¶ä SO YOU WANT TO BE A FRONT-END DEV

This is all **üíØ optional** but if you want to keep your learning streak going, here are some relevant readings. Some of this will be covered directly during Phase 3, but not all of it.

#### A note on terminology

"ES6" stands for "ECMAScript 6", a version of JavaScript that came out in 2015 (ECMA is the organization that governs JavaScript language standards). When people refer to "ES6", they usually mean the set of newer features that were introduced to the JavaScript language in that version. It was a major shift and required developers to get used to some really new things. These features are commonplace now, but the "ES6" name has stuck around.

Many of the features introduced in ES6 are important to know for React.

### JavaScript & React

- [ES6 tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZQc7RUAg18)
- [MDN: A Re-Introduction to JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
- [Modern JavaScript Explained for Dinosaurs](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70)
- [State of JS 2020 Survey Results](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/) -> Read the [Introduction](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/) and [Features](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/features/) sections; the rest you can skim, although it's all pretty interesting.
- [How to think like a Front-End Developer](https://shoptalkshow.com/series/how-to-think-like-a-front-end-developer/) -> Listen to the first episode with Eric Meyer, but all the episodes are really great!
- [How React is different from plain vanilla JS](https://www.framer.com/blog/posts/react-vs-vanilla-js/)
- [Syntax.fm podcast: The React Episode](https://syntax.fm/show/066/the-react-episode)

## üêª SO YOU WANT TO BE A BACK-END DEV

This is all **üíØ optional** but if you want to keep your learning streak going, here are some relevant readings. Some of this will be covered directly during Phase 3, but not all of it.

#### Overview on running production applications

- üéß [Deploying and Running Django Web Apps in 2021](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/301/deploying-and-running-django-web-apps-in-2021) _podcast_
- [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) Have you heard of `SaaS` applications? "Software as a service" is a concept that describes how a lot of modern web applications work. This pretty technical resource is a good (hard) overview that gets into the overlap between development and operational infrastructure (where and how the code runs): DevOps.

#### Debugging in Python

- [Python Debugging with Pdb](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/)
- [Tips for Debugging with `print()`](https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/10/08/tips-for-debugging-with-print/)
- [Damilare Onajole, Debugging Python](https://pyvideo.org/pycon-nigeria-2018/debugging-python-applications-for-profit.html) _conference talk video_


#### Databases and SQL

Confidence working with the database is important for back end devs, so it's worth taking the time to really understand how they work.

We won't need to write SQL in Phase 3 but it's a nice add-on for your technical interviews, and it's a skill you will definitely pick up if your job involves back end work.

- [Full Stack Python: Databases](https://www.fullstackpython.com/databases.html)
- [SQL Basics: Learn x in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/sql/) This may be helpful to skim for familiarity with SQL when you see it. You do not need to write SQL because the Django ORM does it for you, and it does it well. Most developers _can_ drop into SQL if they need to work with the database directly (and they know how to look up the syntax they need!).
- [Learn SQL on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql)
- [SQL Basics Reference](https://hunter-ducharme.gitbook.io/sql-basics/)
- [How SQL queries run](https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/10/03/sql-queries-don-t-start-with-select/) The syntax for SQL queries can be confusing. It can help to understand the order of operations in which your query will run. This is a blog post from the fantastic Julia Evans breaking it down for you.
  - [In tweet form for quick reference](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1179449535938076673)

#### Writing Tests

This is the number one skill you should learn after you finish this program. Writing tests is an _essential_ part of development.

- [Getting Started with Testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/)
- [Django Unit Testing](https://python.plainenglish.io/adventures-in-django-django-unit-testing-bfe5ac697808)


### üëæ If you want to write some code

_This is all optional. You do not need to submit anything._

- [Python Problem Set 1](https://classroom.github.com/a/FkJSjqrt)
- [Python Problem Set 2](https://classroom.github.com/a/op816YKJ)
- Revisit a Django project from Phase 2. Did you get stuck on something that you didn't finish? Practice using the [Python debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) to dig into the code.
- [SQL Tutorial at SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) Not a super shiny UI but a solid walk through for writing SQL.
- [Writing your own SQL queries](https://classroom.github.com/a/KAq-TCKE) This is an assignment I've used in a class where I did teach SQL.
