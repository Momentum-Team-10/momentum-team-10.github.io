You've now seen how to handle data in a Django application with basic operations in these CRUD categories:

* **Create** - when we add a new model instance to the database
* **Read** - when we query the database to look up existing data
* **Update** - when we query the database to find existing data so we can change it
* **Destroy** - when we find existing data in the database and delete it

At the heart of many web applications you'll find variations on this theme, so we'll continue to practice it.

Today we'll add in another essential part of web applications: **user registration and login**.
