## üìπ End of Phase Presentations

This week each of you will record a short video screencast on a topic of your choice. The video should be 4-5 minutes long.

**Your target audience is a brand new Momentum student who is just at the beginning of Phase 3.** Imagine you are teaching them how to do what you've done in this project. Give them the benefit of your experience over these past several weeks.

**This video does not have to be polished, scripted, or edited.** But I should be able to follow what you're saying and understand the points you are making.

I suggest using Loom -- it's very simple to use for screencasts and for camera videos and will let you share your video easily. The free account also limits your videos to 5 minutes, so it should help you with timing!

Loom lets you record a screencast with or without your face showing. You can choose according to your preference.

Please post your video and share the url for it using [this form](https://forms.gle/14ksHEXtGW2PGs1M7). **Your videos are due by 4:00 pm on Wednesday, Dec 22.**

## üêª Back End Guidelines

Your target audience is another beginner developer who is familiar with Django but not with DRF, Postgres, or Heroku. Please pick one of these topics.

1. Pick 1-3 endpoints in your application and talk about how you implemented them. Did you make any interesting decisions or customizations along the way? You might touch on at least some of these topics: the url patterns; the HTTP methods that are handled; serializers; permissions; querysets and any filtering you may have done.
2. Explain serializers, using examples in your app. Show us the serializer code and explain how it relates to models and how it is used in views. Point out any customizations you made and explain why you made them. Show an example JSON response using Insomnia or the browsable API from DRF.
3. What is the most interesting specific feature or technical detail that you implemented for this project? Walk us through its functionality and implementation.

## ü¶ä Front End Guidelines

Your target audience is another beginner developer who is familiar with JavaScript but not with React or Netlify. Please pick one of these topics.

1. Explain the routing in your app. What urls does your app have? How do you handle navigation from component to component. Give us an overview of React Router and how you've used it.
2. Walk us through one of the components in your app and explain how it works. Topics you might touch on: what the purpose/responsibility of the component is; what component renders it and what props it receives from its parent; any state the component has and what that state is for; any events that component handles; any hooks used in the component besides useState (e.g. useEffect, useRef, useLocalStorageState).
3. Build a new teeny tiny React application from scratch and talk us through some of the basics. You can start _after_ creating a new create-react-app application and npm installing all the things; you can start in an App.js that is rendered via an index.js or main.js. Your application should have one component with an input form that echos whatever your user types and displays it on the page in real time. If you want to get fancier than this, you can -- just keep it under 5 minutes.
