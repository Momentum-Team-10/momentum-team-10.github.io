## üóìÔ∏è Today's Topics

- Finishing up with code snippets and flashcards
- End-of-phase technical presentations
- Q&A about Phase 3

## üéØ Django Duplex Project due Thursday @ 2:00 pm

Thursday morning we will not have class. You should use that time to finish work on your project. Amy will be available during regular class hours to help out with whatever assorted issues are happening.

## ü§© End-of-Phase Presentations Thursday @ 2:00 pm

Each person has 4-5 min to talk about one of the following topics using examples from your own code. This should be code that you personally wrote, at least most of it, giving credit to teammates where it's due.

### Topics: Pick one

1. Pick a url, view, and template that you worked on. Walk through what happens in when that url is typed into the browser's address bar. Or, start with a link to that url in your template and go from there.
2. Explain one of your models, talking through any attributes or relationships on that model. Why did you build it this way? You could show us your database using DB Browser for SQLite, an ER Diagram that show relationships with other models, or creating or querying for model objects in the Django shell (or shell_plus).
3. Show a template that you worked on and explain how the code in the template works. You should talk about the view context, any conditional rendering, content blocks, loops, or other interesting template tags and what they are doing in the template. It would be helpful to connect the code in the template to what is rendered in the browser.

### Evaluation & starting the next phase

As with the end-of-phase of Phase 1, presentations are meant to assess what you've learned during the phase and to determine whether you are prepared to begin the next phase.

Your instructors will assess the work you‚Äôve done and determine whether you will go on to the next phase.

The criteria for passing a phase are:

- Your project is complete (it meets most, if not all, criteria in the original assignment).
- You can explain how your code works. Instructors may ask you about any portion of it and you can give a reasonable explanation.

You might be asked to repeat the phase if:

- You are unfamiliar with how your code works.

- You have nothing to present.

If we have any concerns about you passing the phase, you will hear from me on Thursday afternoon, and I'll ask you to meet with me on Friday morning. **If you have any concerns about passing the phase you are welcome to reach out to me or Jessica before then.**
