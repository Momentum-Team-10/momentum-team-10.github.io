title: 🌈 ✨ JavaScript Together 🌈 ✨
tags: phase-1 js ajax fetch team itunes

This week we will review, reinforce, and test our understanding and assumptions about JavaScript. We'll do some live coding in class together. We'll also practice reading errors, debugging, and getting back on track when it feels like you're not making progress.

## In-class Project: Team Programming Exercise

We're going to live code together in class using a practice called _mob programming_. This is like pair programming, with more than two people but still only one computer. We create an application as a group, and everyone participates in figuring out how to implement features and writing the code.
