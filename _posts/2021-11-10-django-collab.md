## ‚úÖ Questions to Check Your Understanding

You've been using Django for about a week now. Can you answer these questions? ü§î

- If you want to show one specific book in the browser, how would that work in the urls and the views?
- How do forms work in Django? You should be able to talk about form objects and how forms are handled in the views.
- Can you create new objects, find objects, and find related objects in the Django shell?
- How does Django know if a user is logged in?
- How can you implement books with multiple categories?

## üéØ Project: Django Team Project

Today we'll begin our first real team project, with a shared repo. This will require more planning, a lot of communication and coordination, and adding on some new Git skills that will let us collaborate.

You will work in a shared repo and **submit one application** that your team will build together. You need to discuss who will do what, but keep in mind that the work needs to be **shared as equally as possible**.

You have two options to choose from for this assignment. Your team should meet to discuss and **decide today** which one you will do.

Then, the very first thing you should do is determine what models you will need and what attributes and relationships they should have. A diagram can be very helpful here.

This assignment is due next Thursday at the end of the Phase.

### Dev Teams

For this project, the first team member listed should accept the assignment and enter the name of your team. The other team members can then accept the assignment and select the repo for their team.

- **Team Hufflepuff**: Trent, Jeffrey, James A.
- **Team Ravenclaw**: Janelle, Zack, James M.
- **Team Gryffindor:** Jordyn, RJ, Lila
- **Team Slytherin:** Trey, Jason, Keanya, Jonathan

### ‚úÖ Project Checklist

- Set up a new Django project from scratch. There is no starter code in the assignment repo.
- Make sure to create a `.gitignore` file to exclude certain files (like your `.env` file and `db.sqlite3`) from Git. You can get one specific to a Django project at [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore). Just search for `Django` and copy and paste the text you find there into your `.gitignore` file. It should be placed at the root of your repo.
- Make sure to create a custom user model, following best practices. **Do this before you run any other migrations.** [This guide may be helpful to you.](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model)
- You may want to install `django-debug-toolbar`, `django-extenstions`, and `django-environ`, as we have done in previous projects.
